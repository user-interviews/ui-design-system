# Modal

## Anatomy:

- **Header:** Which includes the title, helper text and close icon.
- **Body:** It contains the information and / or interface elements for the user to complete a task.
- **Footer:**  It includes the actions to cancel or complete a task. The buttons variants change depending on the modal’s variant. The button group should be right aligned with the main action to complete the task to the utmost right.
- **Overlay** It obscures and disables the content in the back and allows the modal to stand out more.

## Good practices

- Use sparingly, they can be annoying when used too frequently. They are disruptive.
- Avoid cases where we go from one modal to another modal. 
- Use when we want to focus the user’s attention.
- Use to collect input from user.
- Use to show relevant info. 
- Should be initiated by the user: don’t use when user hasn’t triggered the modal.
- They shouldn’t be bloated with many interactions.

## Base modal

- To use in projects as the foundation of any modal. We might need to detach it to customize it.

## Transactional modal

- The user needs to take an action for the modal to be completed and closed. It contains the cancel and primary action buttons.

## Warning modal 

- They appear in anticipation of a significant change. Used mainly to inform but not alarm.

## Danger modal 

- Used for destructive or irreversible actions. We should explain the impact of proceeding with this action.
