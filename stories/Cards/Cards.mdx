# Cards 
Cards serve as containers to help group content on a page, and should always be placed over a background color of `$ux-gray-100` to maintain contrast against the page. 

## Anatomy
- **Header:** Brief descriptor of overall card content
- **Divider line:** 
- **Width:** Card width is defined by, informed by the surrounding layout:
    -  `card-width`: 56rem
    - `card-width-md`: 40rem
    - `card-width-sm`: 32rem
    - `card-width-xs`: 15rem 
- **Padding:** Cards have a 24px padding

## Best practices
- Content inside cards should be left-aligned. Deviations are left up to designer's discretion.
