# Button

## Anatomy:
- **Leading icon (optional):** Should be included when the button has a clear action verb (e.g. Edit, Save, Delete)
- **Label:** Utilizes sentence-casing (e.g. “New project”)
- **Container:** Indicates the button's touch target
- **Trailing icon (optional):** Typically used as a dropdown arrow

## Best practices
- A layout should have one prominent button, the others should clearly be secondary 
- Use sentence casing for all buttons (e.g. “New project”)
- Maintain `verb` + `noun` syntax for labels (e.g. "Save profile" vs "save") 
- Avoid generic messaging such as "Ok" 
- Use 3 or fewer words for each button 
- Use a leading icon alongside a label if there is a primary action verb (e.g. Edit, Share, Copy) 
- Icon-only buttons should only be permitted if
	- Space is limited (e.g. too small for text alone)
	- The icon is standardized or represents an object with a strong physical analog or visual attribute (e.g. floppy disk, pencil)
