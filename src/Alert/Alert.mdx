# Alerts

Alerts give users updates or changes to system status. Providing immediate feedback is important for
building trust.  While alerts are a great way of communicating with users, they are disruptive and
should be used cautiously.

## Anatomy:

- **Icon:** So users can identify the type of alert at a glance.
- **Title:** It should be concise and descriptive so it is easy for users to get what the alert is about
- **Message:** To provide more details so users know the next steps to follow.
- **CTA** ***(currently WIP):*** To provide more details or an escape so users can finish the task they were doing.
- **Close icon:** Closes the alert.

## Success

- Used when something went as planned. Ex. When you've saved your progress in the builder.

## Info

- Information that needs to be referenced often or is very important. These alerts are within the
page and are not affected by an event, whereas success/error alerts are at the top of the page
based on an event. These alerts will always be blue!

## Error

- Used when something did not go as planned, and action is needed to proceed. Ex. If you leave
the incentive field blank in the builder and try to launch, you' receive an error. You must
fill in the field to launch a project.

## Warning

- Messages used for general information on a more temporary level, not based on the user
performing an action. Ex. For Covid, we show a yellow alert to encourage researcher to
consult CDC guidelines for in person sessions.
