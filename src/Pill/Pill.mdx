## Formatting

### States

### Anatomy
- **Content: ** main content area of the Pill. Can be provided plain text or a link (`<a>`) as `children`
- **Icon: ** relevant icon that makes it easier for users to identify (always placed left of the Content)
- **Close: ** users have the option to clear the pill (provided by default with the presence of the `onClose` function)

### Alignment


## Best practices

### General

### Behavior

### Implementation
- Use the `PILL_COLORS` constant when setting the `color` prop
- Can use either the `text` prop or provide an element via `children` for content. (Note: the `text` prop is planned to be retired in favor of `children` in a future release)
- If using plain text or an element as the content via `children`, do not wrap in block-level elements (e.g. `<p>` or `div`)
