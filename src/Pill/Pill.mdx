## Anatomy

- **Content: ** main content area of the Pill. Can be provided plain text or a link (`<a>`) as `children`
- **Icon: ** relevant icon that makes it easier for users to identify (always placed left of the Content)
- **Close: ** users have the option to clear the pill (provided by default with the presence of the `onClose` function)

## Best practices 

- Use to label, categorize, or organize items using keywords that describe them
- Help users search for and find related content quickly and easily
- Use to highlight an item's status for quick recognition 
- Ideal to indicate meanings that users can learn and recognize across the app

## Stories

### Default
- The default Pill and available colors
- Use the `PILL_COLORS` constant when setting the `color` prop
- Can use either the `text` prop or provide an element via `children` for content. (Note: the `text` prop is planned to be retired in favor of `children` in a future release)
- If using plain text or an element as the content via `children`, do not wrap in block-level elements (e.g. `<p>` or `div`)
