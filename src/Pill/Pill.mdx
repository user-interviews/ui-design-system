</h4>

### With Container
- The `Pills` container should be used when a collection of `Pill` components are displayed

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-pill--with-container" />
</Canvas>

### With Leading Icon
- Import an icon that is most relevant to the text

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-pill--with-leading-icon" />
</Canvas>

### With Close
- For Pills that need to option to be closed

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-pill--with-close" />
</Canvas>

### With Link
- For Pills that link to more information
- The Pill accepts an `<a>` tag as a child

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-pill--with-link" />
</Canvas>


## Formatting

### Anatomy
- **Content: ** main content area of the Pill. Can be provided plain text or a link (`<a>`) as `children`
- **Icon: ** relevant icon that makes it easier for users to identify (always placed left of the Content)
- **Close: ** users have the option to clear the pill (provided by default with the presence of the `onClose` function)

## Best practices

### Implementation
- Use the `PILL_COLORS` constant when setting the `color` prop
- Can use either the `text` prop or provide an element via `children` for content. (Note: the `text` prop is planned to be retired in favor of `children` in a future release)
- If using plain text or an element as the content via `children`, do not wrap in block-level elements (e.g. `<p>` or `div`)
