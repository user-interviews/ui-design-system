## Anatomy

- **Text: ** main descriptor of the pill
- **Icon: ** relevant icon that makes it easier for users to identify (always placed left of the Text)
- **Close: ** users have the option to clear the pill (provided by default with the presence of the `onClose` function)
- **Link: ** an optional link to more information 

## Best practices 

- Use to label, categorize, or organize items using keywords that describe them
- Help users search for and find related content quickly and easily
- Use to highlight an item's status for quick recognition 
- Ideal to indicate meanings that users can learn and recognize across the app
