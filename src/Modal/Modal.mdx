# Modal

##

<h4>
  Modals are large UI elements that sit on top of an application's main window—often with a layer of transparency behind them to give users a peek into the main app. 
  To return to the application's main interface, users must interact with the modal layer.
</h4>

### When to use 
- Use when we want to focus the user’s attention
- Use to collect input from user
- Use to show relevant info

### When to not use
- Interruption of user flow: Modal dialogs can interrupt the user's flow and cause frustration, especially if they appear unexpectedly or are difficult to dismiss. If the information or input required can be displayed or collected in a non-intrusive way, it is generally better to avoid using a modal.

## Props 

<ArgTypes of={Modal} />


## Stories

### Default

- The most common modal that will be used.

### Medium Modal 

- For a wider content area. 

### Large Modal

- For a large content area. 

### Transactional modal

- The user needs to take an action for the modal to be completed and closed. It contains the cancel and primary action buttons.

### Warning modal 

- They appear in anticipation of a significant change. Used mainly to inform but not alarm.

### Danger modal 

- Used for a destructive or irreversible action. The impact of taking this action should be explained clearly to the user.


## Formatting

### States

### Anatomy 
- **Header:** Includes the title, helper text and close icon
- **Body:** Contains the information and / or interface elements for the user to complete a task
- **Footer:**  Includes the actions to cancel or complete a task. The buttons variants change depending on the modal’s variant. 
- **Overlay** Obscures and disables the background content

### Sizing
- `small`, `medium`, `large`

### Alignment


## Best practices

### General

- The button group should be right aligned with the main action to complete the task to the utmost right.
- Use sparingly, they can be annoying when used too frequently. They are disruptive

### Behavior

- Avoid cases where we go from one modal to another modal
- Should be initiated by the user: don’t use when user hasn’t triggered the modal

### Implementation

- Should not include more than 2 interactions

`ModalHeader` 
- Only use the `title` prop to display the title
- Always use the `onRequestClose` prop to ensure the close button is available for users in the top right-hand corner
- Don't add a leading icon unless it's `variant` of 'warning' or 'danger'

`ModalBody`
- Always wrap your content in an element 
-  `<p>` If the body content of the modal is only text 
- Sub-headings should be no larger than an `h5`
- If the content is more complex (e.g. forms, lists, checkboxes, etc.) reach out to the design team for clarification on consistency

```
DO: 

<ModalBody>
  <p>Some content goes here.</p>
</ModalBody>

DON'T:

<ModalBody>
  Some content goes here.
</ModalBody>

```

`ModalFooter`
- Always ensure you are using the proper button 
- `variant='warning'` should use the primary button and color 
- `variant='danger'` should use the danger button and color 

### UX Copy
1. **Be clear and concise:** Exercise brevity over personality and use precise language.
2. **Use active voice:** Active voice = the subject performs the action denoted by the verb.
3. **Lead with what’s important:** Hit on higher priority information as early on as possible.
4. **Be as helpful as possible:** Include more recommendations, details, etc over personality.
5. **Be consistent:** Be mindful to keep terminology, sentence structure, type casing, etc the same
