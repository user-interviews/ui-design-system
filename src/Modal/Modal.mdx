# Modal

##

<h4>
  Modals are large UI elements that sit on top of an application's main window—often with a layer of transparency behind them to give users a peek into the main app. 
  To return to the application's main interface, users must interact with the modal layer.
</h4>

### When to use 
- Use when we want to focus the user’s attention
- Use to collect input from user
- Use to show relevant info

### When to not use
- Reason 1
- Reason 2

## Props 

<ArgsTable of={Modal} />


## Stories

### Default

- To use in projects as the foundation of any modal. We might need to detach it to customize it.

### Medium Modal 

- For a wider content area. 

### Large Modal

- For a large content area. 

### Transactional modal

- The user needs to take an action for the modal to be completed and closed. It contains the cancel and primary action buttons.

### Warning modal 

- They appear in anticipation of a significant change. Used mainly to inform but not alarm.

### Danger modal 

- Used for destructive or irreversible actions. We should explain the impact of proceeding with this action.


## Formatting

### States

### Anatomy 
- **Header:** Includes the title, helper text and close icon
- **Body:** Contains the information and / or interface elements for the user to complete a task
- **Footer:**  Includes the actions to cancel or complete a task. The buttons variants change depending on the modal’s variant. 
- **Overlay** Obscures and disables the background content

### Sizing
- `small`, `medium`, `large`

### Alignment


## Best practices

### General

- The button group should be right aligned with the main action to complete the task to the utmost right.
- Use sparingly, they can be annoying when used too frequently. They are disruptive

### Behavior

- Avoid cases where we go from one modal to another modal
- Should be initiated by the user: don’t use when user hasn’t triggered the modal

### Implementation

- Should not include more than 2 interactions

`ModalHeader` 
- Only use the `title` prop to display the title
- Always use the `onRequestClose` prop to ensure the close button is available for users in the top right-hand corner
- Don't add a leading icon unless it's `variant` of 'warning' or 'danger'

`ModalBody`
- Always wrap your content in an element 
-  `<p>` If the body content of the modal is only text 
- Sub-headings should be no larger than an `h5`
- If the content is more complex (e.g. forms, lists, checkboxes, etc.) reach out to the design team for clarification on consistency

```
DO: 

<ModalBody>
  <p>Some content goes here.</p>
</ModalBody>

DON'T:

<ModalBody>
  Some content goes here.
</ModalBody>

```

`ModalFooter`
- Always ensure you are using the proper button 
- `variant='warning'` should use the primary button and color 
- `variant='danger'` should use the danger button and color 

### UX Copy
1. **Be clear and concise:** Exercise brevity over personality and use precise language.
2. **Use active voice:** Active voice = the subject performs the action denoted by the verb.
3. **Lead with what’s important:** Hit on higher priority information as early on as possible.
4. **Be as helpful as possible:** Include more recommendations, details, etc over personality.
5. **Be consistent:** Be mindful to keep terminology, sentence structure, type casing, etc the same
