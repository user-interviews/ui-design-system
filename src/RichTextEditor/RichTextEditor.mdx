# RichTextEditor

<h4>
  RichTextEditor is a field element which provides a "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) editor for HTML content.
</h4>

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Default} />

### When to use 
To allow users to edit text where formatting is important, such as messages to be sent via email.

### When to not use
When formatting is not important. In those cases regular form inputs are a better fit.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={RichTextEditor} />

## Stories

By default RichTextEditor includes all available formatting actions.
If you'd like to limit which options are available you can do so by passing the actions you'd like to the `availableActions` prop in an array.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.AvailableActions} />

If you set a character limit then the length of the inputted text will be restricted accordingly, including if longer text is pasted.
A counter will also be shown below the input so you know how close you are to hitting the limit.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.CharacterLimit} />

You are also able to limit input to one line. This can be useful in situations where a limited amount of text is idea, but formatting is important.
The `isOneLine` and `characterLimit` props can be used together in cases where you really need to restrict text length.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.OneLine} />

RichTextEditor also has an error state to display that the input is invalid. The most common use case for this is when it is a required field and the input is empty,
but by setting `hasErrors` via your provided `onChange` callback you can check the HTML produced by the RichTextEditor for any requirements that you have.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Error} />
