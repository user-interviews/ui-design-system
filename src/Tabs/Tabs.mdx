# Tabs
Create dynamic tabbed interfaces, as described in the [WAI ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#tabpanel). Tabs is a higher-level component for quickly creating a Nav matched with a set of TabPanes.

These are wrapped and styled [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) `Tabs` and `Tab` components. Refer to [React Bootstrap `Tabs`](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/tabs/) documentation as the source of truth.

## Best Practices

There are two ways use the `Tabs` component, controlled or uncontrolled. Uncontrolled `Tabs` simply switch tab content based on user interaction, where as controlled `Tabs` require a function passed in as the `onSelect` prop to set to the `activeKey`.

Since we should always be tracking user interactions it is highly recommended to use controlled `Tabs` so that tracking can be added to the `onSelect` function. This is also very useful when using `Tabs` without `Tab` content.

## Tabs Anatomy

<ArgTypes of={Tabs} />

- **activeKey:** string which matches the `Tab` **eventKey** which should be active on initial load *and* update this prop from the `onSelect` function
- **defaultActiveKey:** The default active key that is selected on start
- **id:** HTML id attribute, required
- **mountOnEnter:** Wait until the first "enter" transition to mount tabs (add them to the DOM)
- **transition:** Sets a default animation strategy for all children `<TabPane>`s. Not currently used.
- **unmountOnExit:** Unmount tabs (remove it from the DOM) when it is no longer visible
- **onSelect:** Callback fired when a Tab is selected.

### Controlled Tabs
- **activeKey:** Required
- **defaultActiveKey:** Leave undefined
- **onSelect:** Required

### Uncontrolled Tabs
- **activeKey:** Leave undefined
- **defaultActiveKey:** Required
- **onSelect:** Leave undefined

## Tab Anatomy

<ArgTypes of={Tab} />

- **disabled:** The disabled state of the tab.
- **eventKey:** A unique identifier for the Component, the eventKey makes it distinguishable from others in a set. Similar to React's key prop, in that it only needs to be unique amongst the Components siblings, not globally.
- **tabClassName:** Class to pass to the underlying nav link.
- **title:** Content for the tab title.
