### Heading

Use to create various levels of hierarchy on the page.

#### Best practices:

**DO**
- Use one unique `h1` per page that describes what that page is about, preferably starts just above the main content.
- Use headings to describe the content below. Do not use an HTML heading just to make the text appear bigger or stand out.

**DON'T**
- Do not choose a heading by its size, but by its level in the context of the content.
- Do not skip a heading level from the top down. 


#### What does hierarchical mean?

Hierarchical means arranged in order from most important to least important. The `h1` is the most important heading level, the `h6` the least.

In practice, for web content, you will use the `h1` for the page title, give the most important sections an `h2`, and, if needed, add an `h3` or maybe even an `h4` to divide the content in the `h2` section.

You only need to start with the `h1` if that makes sense for your content structure and design.


#### Accessibility

**Summary:** 
- Use headings to describe content and use them consistently and semantically. This will help all users to better find the content they are looking for.
- Font weight and size may be changed from `Typography` defaults as long as the semantics are correct.


**WCAG2 AA success criteria:**

- [Success Criterion: 2.4.6 Headings and labels.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#headings-and-labels) Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are. Headings and labels describe topic or purpose.
- [Success Criterion: 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation Level.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=246#consistent-navigation) Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.
- [Success Criterion: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=246#info-and-relationships) Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. In other words: if it looks like a heading, it should be a heading in the HTML (and not for example text made bold).

### Body

Use to create a range of body text.
These styles are primarily used within components and blocks of text.

Use variant `bodyLg`, `bodyMd`, or `bodySm`. 

**Default:** `bodyMd` is the default for the `Typography` component and is the most common body text variant.

### Alignment

Use to set text alignment: `start`, `center`, or `end`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-typography--alignment" />
</Canvas>

### Weight

Use to give text a one of the supported font weights: `bold`, `medium`, or `regular`.

**Default:** `regular` font weight is the `Typography` default.
