# FormGroup

##

<h4>
  The FormGroup component wraps a form control with proper spacing, along with support for a label, helper text, and validation state.
  Here we use an Input field as the form control.
</h4>

## Props

<ArgTypes of={FormGroup} />

## Stories

### Default with placeholder

- Used to give the user an idea of what sort text they should include here. Does not carry over as
 default text if no other text is added, so if left blank will produce an error.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Default} />

### With Helper Text

- Information tied to a field that gives suggestions or additional information that might
be beneficial to the user

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithHelperText} />

### Required

- To indicate that a field is required, display "(Required)" next to the label
- If some fields are required, indicate all required ones
- If most fields are required, indicate optional fields by displaying "(Optional)" next to the label

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Required} />

### No margin

- Remove the default margin on the FormGroup.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.NoMargin} />

### With Label Tooltip

- Information users will typically only reference once (and then it's learned) or here and there.
This information is typically more of a recommendation, and not vital for the user to know, but
helpful if they do!

### Leading Icon

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithLeadingIcon} />

### Trailing Text

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithTrailingText} />

### Trailing Icon

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithTrailingIcon} />

### Trailing Icon with Button

- This has a trailing icon wrapped in a button you can pass an onClick function to.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithTrailingIconAndButton} />

### Leading & Trailing Icons

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithLeadingAndTrailingIcons} />

### Error

- Keep the text as short as possible; for complex info, provide a link to more information
in a new browser tab
- **Accessibility:**
  - When `displayErrorText` is true, be sure to set an `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby='form-errors-${inputKey}'` 
on the invalid input when there is an error so that screen readers will read the error message.
