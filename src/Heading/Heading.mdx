# Heading

##

<h4>
  Headings are used as the titles of each major section of a page in the interface. 
</h4>

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Default} />


## Props

<ArgTypes of={Heading} />

## Stories


### Default

A default `Heading` as a level `2` with size `xxl` and weight `bold`

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Default} />


### Levels

Use the appropriate heading level to create hierarchy on the page.

Adjust the font `size` with the available sizes:

`xxxl`, `xxl`, `xl`, `lg`, `md`, `sm`, `xs`

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Levels} />

#### Best practices:

**DO**
- Use one unique `h1` per page that describes what that page is about, preferably starts just above the main content.

**DON'T**
- Do not choose a heading by its size, but by its level in the context of the content.
- Do not skip a heading level from the top down. 

#### Accessibility

**Summary:** 
- Use headings to describe content and use them consistently and semantically. This will help all users to better find the content they are looking for.
- Font weight and size may be changed from `Heading` defaults as long as the semantic hierarchy is correct.


**WCAG2 AA success criteria:**

- [Success Criterion: 2.4.6 Headings and labels.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#headings-and-labels) Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are. Headings and labels describe topic or purpose.
- [Success Criterion: 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation Level.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=246#consistent-navigation) Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.
- [Success Criterion: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=246#info-and-relationships) Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. In other words: if it looks like a heading, it should be a heading in the HTML (and not for example text made bold).


### Weights

Use to give heading one of the supported font weights:

`bold`, `medium`, or `regular`

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Weights} />


### Alignment

Use to set heading alignment:

`left`, `center`, or `right`

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Alignment} />
