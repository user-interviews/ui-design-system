# EmptyState

##

<h4>
  EmptyState signals to the user that there is no data or content to display in a specific area the app,
  often including messages or actions to guide user in populating the area.
</h4>

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.PrimaryAction} />


## Props

<ArgTypes of={EmptyState} />

## Stories

### Default
- Header should be short and to the point describing the empty state. 
- Description provides a bit more detail and the sentence should always end with punctuation. Most of the time it will be a period.

### Primary Action
- Avoid using a CTA that is the same action as the item the descriptor text is pointing to in the bottom nav bar. Instead the description should point them to that action.

### Full Width
- Set the content area to full width.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.FullWidth} />

### Margin Top
- Use a pre-defined set of `margin-top` values: `sm`, `md`, and `lg`
- Typically, the larger the empty state area, the larger the `margin-top` value
- Rules of thumb: set `marginTop` to `sm` when in a Card, `md` when on an empty page with other components present, and `lg` when EmptyState is the only thing present on a page.
