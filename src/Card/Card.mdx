Cards serve as containers to help group content on a page, and should always be placed over a background color of `$ux-gray-100` to maintain contrast against the page.

## Anatomy

- **Title:** Brief descriptor of overall card content
- **Helper text:** Provided to the right of the header
- **Subtitle:** Additional context for card content
- **Divider line:** Creates visual separation between title and content 
- **Width:** Card width is defined by, informed by the surrounding layout:
	- `card-width`: 56rem
	- `card-width-md`: 40rem
	- `card-width-sm`: 32rem
	- `card-width-xs`: 15rem 
- **Padding:** Cards have a `padding`: 1.5rem by default 

## Best practices
- Content inside cards should be left-aligned. Deviations are left up to the designer's discretion.
