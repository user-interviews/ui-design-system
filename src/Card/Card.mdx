## Formatting

### States

### Anatomy

- **Title:** Brief descriptor of overall card content
- **Helper text:** Provided to the right of the header
- **Subtitle:** Additional context for card content
- **Divider line:** Creates visual separation between title and content
- **Padding:** Cards have a `padding`: 1.5rem by default

### Sizing

- **Width:** Card width is defined by, informed by the surrounding layout:
	- `card-width`: 56rem
	- `card-width-md`: 40rem
	- `card-width-sm`: 32rem
	- `card-width-xs`: 15rem

### Alignment


## Best practices

### General

- Content inside cards should generally be left-aligned. Deviations are left up to the designer's discretion.
- Avoid using custom HTML elements for the Title, Subtitle, or Helper text unless explicitly told by a designer. Use designated props for these.
