# LoadingOverlay

##

<h4>
  A visual indicator for a loading state.
</h4>

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Default} />

### When to use
- Long loading times: If your application takes a long time to load data or process requests, using a LoadingOverlay component can help improve user experience by providing a visual indication that the application is still functioning and hasn't frozen.
- Complex user interactions: If your application has complex user interactions that require processing time, such as a form with multiple fields or a search feature that queries a large database, using a LoadingOverlay component can help indicate to users that their input is being processed.

### When to not use
- Short loading times: If your application loads data quickly, using a LoadingOverlay component may not be necessary and could actually be distracting to users.
- Inappropriate context: If the loading process is not critical to the user experience, it may not be necessary to use a LoadingOverlay component. In some cases, it may even be better to not use a LoadingOverlay component to avoid distracting users from the main content.
